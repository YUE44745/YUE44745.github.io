Hello, I am UpstreamWind.

My major is Intergrated Circuit Design and Intergrated System. And I am intersted in circuit and various techniques. 

I love cycling, climbing and hiking. And I'm also a fan of 中島みゆきさんです(Miyuki Nakajima), her songs bring me a lot. The New Age is also my favorite, which can bring me serenity.
